Decision memory tool that captures why choices were made — before outcomes distort recall.
# EchoMap

EchoMap is a lightweight decision memory tool.

It helps you record **why a decision was made**, including assumptions and context,
at the moment of choice — before outcomes introduce hindsight bias.

## Why this exists

People remember outcomes, not reasoning.
That leads to repeated mistakes and false confidence.

EchoMap preserves intent.

## What it does (MVP)

- Log decisions with title, reasoning, and assumptions
- Timestamp entries automatically
- Store data locally in the browser
- Review past decisions in chronological order

No accounts. No cloud. No AI.

## What it is not

- Not a task manager
- Not a note-taking app
- Not a prediction tool

EchoMap is a **decision ledger**.

## How to use

1. Open the app
2. Write the decision you're about to make
3. Capture your assumptions honestly
4. Save
5. Revisit later — especially when outcomes surprise you

## Status

Early prototype. Built to test usefulness, not scale.
